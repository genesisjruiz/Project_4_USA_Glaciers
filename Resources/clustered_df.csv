This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.  The resulting basins were then manually edited to fix errors and better represent reality.",Alaska,0,0,9,1,6,0,48

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.  The resulting basins were then manually edited to fix errors and better represent reality.",Alaska,0,0,9,1,6,0,48

Basin delineation was aided by an algorithm developed by C.

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.  The resulting basins were then manually edited to fix errors and better represent reality.",Alaska,0,0,9,1,6,0,27

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.

The glacier outlines were initially created from USGS 1:63,360-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) files.  Because these ""glacier and permanent snowfield"" outlines often had digitizing errors, we laboriously edited them to fit the Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) files.  Thus, they represent what is on the DRG files, which in turn represent what is shown on the topo maps, which in turn shows what existed on the ground at the time the air photos were flown to make the maps.  The processing for these files was exactly the same as described in Manley (2008): Manley, W.F., 2008, Geospatial inventory and analysis of glaciers: A case study for the eastern Alaska Range, in Glaciers of Alaska, Williams, R. S., Jr., and Ferrigno, J. G., eds., Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World: USGS Professional Paper 1386-K, p. K424-K439. Explanation of some attributes: -Average aspect (facing direction, orientation) in degrees azimuth incorporates circular statistics (cf. Davis, 1986). -ELA60 is the ""hypsometric"" Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) using an Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR). For this Area, the AAR used was 60%. -cmpctnss: glacier compactness is a shape measure reflecting circularity (cf. Allen et al., 1998).  A non-dimensional measure, it ranges from 0.0 for a straight line to 1.0 for a circle, and is calculated as (4 * pi * area ) / (perimeter squared). -slope: average slope angle, in degrees, for each of the M1 glaciers.  It uses the slope angle grid generated from the DEM, then simply calculates, or scores, the average slope angle across the surface of each glacier. -L_W_ratio: his script calculates the length to width ratio, which is a shape factor that might be of use later for classifying or comparing glaciers. The length:width ratio is <1.0 for short but wide glaciers hugging cirque headwalls, and is > ca. 5 for long valley glaciers. -Length: glacier length was determined as the length of the longest flowline for each glacier. -Bsns_elev_med: median elev of glacier basins",Alaska,0,0,9,1,2,0,85

Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.

The glacier outlines were initially created from USGS 1:63,360-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) files.  Because these ""glacier and permanent snowfield"" outlines often had digitizing errors, we laboriously edited them to fit the Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) files.  Thus, they represent what is on the DRG files, which in turn represent what is shown on the topo maps, which in turn shows what existed on the ground at the time the air photos were flown to make the maps.  The processing for these files was exactly the same as described in Manley (2008): Manley, W.F., 2008, Geospatial inventory and analysis of glaciers: A case study for the eastern Alaska Range, in Glaciers of Alaska, Williams, R. S., Jr., and Ferrigno, J. G., eds., Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World: USGS Professional Paper 1386-K, p. K424-K439. Explanation of some attributes: -Average aspect (facing direction, orientation) in degrees azimuth incorporates circular statistics (cf. Davis, 1986). -ELA60 is the ""hypsometric"" Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) using an Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR). For this Area, the AAR used was 60%. -cmpctnss: glacier compactness is a shape measure reflecting circularity (cf. Allen et al., 1998).  A non-dimensional measure, it ranges from 0.0 for a straight line to 1.0 for a circle, and is calculated as (4 * pi * area ) / (perimeter squared). -slope: average slope angle, in degrees, for each of the M1 glaciers.  It uses the slope angle grid generated from the DEM, then simply calculates, or scores, the average slope angle across the surface of each glacier. -L_W_ratio: his script calculates the length to width ratio, which is a shape factor that might be of use later for classifying or comparing glaciers. The length:width ratio is <1.0 for short but wide glaciers hugging cirque headwalls, and is > ca. 5 for long valley glaciers. -Length: glacier length was determined as the length of the longest flowline for each glacier. -Bsns_elev_med: median elev of glacier basins",Alaska,0,0,9,1,2,0,85

The glacier outlines were initially created from USGS 1:63,360-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) files.  Because these ""glacier and permanent snowfield"" outlines often had digitizing errors, we laboriously edited them to fit the Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) files.  Thus, they represent what is on the DRG files, which in turn represent what is shown on the topo maps, which in turn shows what existed on the ground at the time the air photos were flown to make the maps.  The processing for these files was exactly the same as described in Manley (2008): Manley, W.F., 2008, Geospatial inventory and analysis of glaciers: A case study for the eastern Alaska Range, in Glaciers of Alaska, Williams, R. S., Jr., and Ferrigno, J. G., eds., Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World: USGS Professional Paper 1386-K, p. K424-K439. Explanation of some attributes: -Average aspect (facing direction, orientation) in degrees azimuth incorporates circular statistics (cf. Davis, 1986). -ELA60 is the ""hypsometric"" Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) using an Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR). For this Area, the AAR used was 60%. -cmpctnss: glacier compactness is a shape measure reflecting circularity (cf. Allen et al., 1998).  A non-dimensional measure, it ranges from 0.0 for a straight line to 1.0 for a circle, and is calculated as (4 * pi * area ) / (perimeter squared). -slope: average slope angle, in degrees, for each of the M1 glaciers.  It uses the slope angle grid generated from the DEM, then simply calculates, or scores, the average slope angle across the surface of each glacier. -L_W_ratio: his script calculates the length to width ratio, which is a shape factor that might be of use later for classifying or comparing glaciers. The length:width ratio is <1.0 for short but wide glaciers hugging cirque headwalls, and is > ca. 5 for long valley glaciers. -Length: glacier length was determined as the length of the longest flowline for each glacier. -Bsns_elev_med: median elev of glacier basins",Alaska,0,0,9,1,2,0,85

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.  The resulting basins were then manually edited to fix errors and better represent reality.",Alaska,0,0,9,1,6,0,51

Kienholz.; Landsat ETM+ images (LE70590192010259EDC00 and LE70600192010266EDC01) were downloaded from the USGS Earth Explorer (http://edcsns17.cr.usgs.gov/NewEarthExplorer/) and run through a de-striping algorithm.  This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.  The resulting basins were then manually edited to fix errors and better represent reality.",Alaska,0,0,9,1,6,0,51

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.

The glacier outlines were initially created from USGS 1:63,360-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) files.  Because these ""glacier and permanent snowfield"" outlines often had digitizing errors, we laboriously edited them to fit the Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) files.  Thus, they represent what is on the DRG files, which in turn represent what is shown on the topo maps, which in turn shows what existed on the ground at the time the air photos were flown to make the maps.  The processing for these files was exactly the same as described in Manley (2008): Manley, W.F., 2008, Geospatial inventory and analysis of glaciers: A case study for the eastern Alaska Range, in Glaciers of Alaska, Williams, R. S., Jr., and Ferrigno, J. G., eds., Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World: USGS Professional Paper 1386-K, p. K424-K439. Explanation of some attributes: -Average aspect (facing direction, orientation) in degrees azimuth incorporates circular statistics (cf. Davis, 1986). -ELA60 is the ""hypsometric"" Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) using an Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR). For this Area, the AAR used was 60%. -cmpctnss: glacier compactness is a shape measure reflecting circularity (cf. Allen et al., 1998).  A non-dimensional measure, it ranges from 0.0 for a straight line to 1.0 for a circle, and is calculated as (4 * pi * area ) / (perimeter squared). -slope: average slope angle, in degrees, for each of the M1 glaciers.  It uses the slope angle grid generated from the DEM, then simply calculates, or scores, the average slope angle across the surface of each glacier. -L_W_ratio: his script calculates the length to width ratio, which is a shape factor that might be of use later for classifying or comparing glaciers. The length:width ratio is <1.0 for short but wide glaciers hugging cirque headwalls, and is > ca. 5 for long valley glaciers. -Length: glacier length was determined as the length of the longest flowline for each glacier. -Bsns_elev_med: median elev of glacier basins",Alaska,0,0,9,1,2,0,85

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.

For this Area, the AAR used was 60%. -cmpctnss: glacier compactness is a shape measure reflecting circularity (cf. Allen et al., 1998).  A non-dimensional measure, it ranges from 0.0 for a straight line to 1.0 for a circle, and is calculated as (4 * pi * area ) / (perimeter squared). -slope: average slope angle, in degrees, for each of the M1 glaciers.  It uses the slope angle grid generated from the DEM, then simply calculates, or scores, the average slope angle across the surface of each glacier. -L_W_ratio: his script calculates the length to width ratio, which is a shape factor that might be of use later for classifying or comparing glaciers. The length:width ratio is <1.0 for short but wide glaciers hugging cirque headwalls, and is > ca. 5 for long valley glaciers. -Length: glacier length was determined as the length of the longest flowline for each glacier. -Bsns_elev_med: median elev of glacier basins",Alaska,0,0,9,1,2,0,85

The glacier outlines were initially created from USGS 1:63,360-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) files.  Because these ""glacier and permanent snowfield"" outlines often had digitizing errors, we laboriously edited them to fit the Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) files.  Thus, they represent what is on the DRG files, which in turn represent what is shown on the topo maps, which in turn shows what existed on the ground at the time the air photos were flown to make the maps.  The processing for these files was exactly the same as described in Manley (2008): Manley, W.F., 2008, Geospatial inventory and analysis of glaciers: A case study for the eastern Alaska Range, in Glaciers of Alaska, Williams, R. S., Jr., and Ferrigno, J. G., eds., Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World: USGS Professional Paper 1386-K, p. K424-K439. Explanation of some attributes: -Average aspect (facing direction, orientation) in degrees azimuth incorporates circular statistics (cf. Davis, 1986). -ELA60 is the ""hypsometric"" Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) using an Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR). For this Area, the AAR used was 60%. -cmpctnss: glacier compactness is a shape measure reflecting circularity (cf. Allen et al., 1998).  A non-dimensional measure, it ranges from 0.0 for a straight line to 1.0 for a circle, and is calculated as (4 * pi * area ) / (perimeter squared). -slope: average slope angle, in degrees, for each of the M1 glaciers.  It uses the slope angle grid generated from the DEM, then simply calculates, or scores, the average slope angle across the surface of each glacier. -L_W_ratio: his script calculates the length to width ratio, which is a shape factor that might be of use later for classifying or comparing glaciers. The length:width ratio is <1.0 for short but wide glaciers hugging cirque headwalls, and is > ca. 5 for long valley glaciers. -Length: glacier length was determined as the length of the longest flowline for each glacier. -Bsns_elev_med: median elev of glacier basins",Alaska,0,0,9,1,2,0,85

Glacier outlines were manually digitized from Landsat images using ESRI    ArcGIS Protm version 2.2.0, GIS digitizing tools.  False color composite    bands of red and green (5, 4, 3), were used to digitize glaciers. Before    digitizing each glacier, the location of stationary landmarks on    topographic maps and Landsat images were compared to determine if manual    georeferencing corrections were necessary.  RGI outline shapefiles (RGI    Consortium, 2017)  provided the initial glacier boundaries and divides into    the upper portions of the glaciers.  The individual digitized glacier    boundaries were then adjusted manually based on the interpretation of    Landsat images.

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.  The resulting basins were then manually edited to fix errors and better represent reality.",Alaska,0,0,9,1,6,0,48

The glacier outlines were initially created from USGS 1:63,360-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) files.  Because these ""glacier and permanent snowfield"" outlines often had digitizing errors, we laboriously edited them to fit the Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) files.  Thus, they represent what is on the DRG files, which in turn represent what is shown on the topo maps, which in turn shows what existed on the ground at the time the air photos were flown to make the maps.  The processing for these files was exactly the same as described in Manley (2008): Manley, W.F., 2008, Geospatial inventory and analysis of glaciers: A case study for the eastern Alaska Range, in Glaciers of Alaska, Williams, R. S., Jr., and Ferrigno, J. G., eds., Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World: USGS Professional Paper 1386-K, p. K424-K439. Explanation of some attributes: -Average aspect (facing direction, orientation) in degrees azimuth incorporates circular statistics (cf. Davis, 1986). -ELA60 is the ""hypsometric"" Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) using an Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR). For this Area, the AAR used was 60%. -cmpctnss: glacier compactness is a shape measure reflecting circularity (cf. Allen et al., 1998).  A non-dimensional measure, it ranges from 0.0 for a straight line to 1.0 for a circle, and is calculated as (4 * pi * area ) / (perimeter squared). -slope: average slope angle, in degrees, for each of the M1 glaciers.  It uses the slope angle grid generated from the DEM, then simply calculates, or scores, the average slope angle across the surface of each glacier. -L_W_ratio: his script calculates the length to width ratio, which is a shape factor that might be of use later for classifying or comparing glaciers. The length:width ratio is <1.0 for short but wide glaciers hugging cirque headwalls, and is > ca. 5 for long valley glaciers. -Length: glacier length was determined as the length of the longest flowline for each glacier. -Bsns_elev_med: median elev of glacier basins",Alaska,0,0,9,1,2,0,32

Basin delineation was aided by an algorithm developed by C.

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.  The resulting basins were then manually edited to fix errors and better represent reality.",Alaska,0,0,9,1,6,0,27

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.  The resulting basins were then manually edited to fix errors and better represent reality.",Alaska,0,0,9,1,6,0,51

The glacier outlines were initially created from USGS 1:63,360-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) files.  Because these ""glacier and permanent snowfield"" outlines often had digitizing errors, we laboriously edited them to fit the Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) files.  Thus, they represent what is on the DRG files, which in turn represent what is shown on the topo maps, which in turn shows what existed on the ground at the time the air photos were flown to make the maps.  The processing for these files was exactly the same as described in Manley (2008): Manley, W.F., 2008, Geospatial inventory and analysis of glaciers: A case study for the eastern Alaska Range, in Glaciers of Alaska, Williams, R. S., Jr., and Ferrigno, J. G., eds., Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World: USGS Professional Paper 1386-K, p. K424-K439. Explanation of some attributes: -Average aspect (facing direction, orientation) in degrees azimuth incorporates circular statistics (cf. Davis, 1986). -ELA60 is the ""hypsometric"" Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) using an Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR). For this Area, the AAR used was 60%. -cmpctnss: glacier compactness is a shape measure reflecting circularity (cf. Allen et al., 1998).  A non-dimensional measure, it ranges from 0.0 for a straight line to 1.0 for a circle, and is calculated as (4 * pi * area ) / (perimeter squared). -slope: average slope angle, in degrees, for each of the M1 glaciers.  It uses the slope angle grid generated from the DEM, then simply calculates, or scores, the average slope angle across the surface of each glacier. -L_W_ratio: his script calculates the length to width ratio, which is a shape factor that might be of use later for classifying or comparing glaciers. The length:width ratio is <1.0 for short but wide glaciers hugging cirque headwalls, and is > ca. 5 for long valley glaciers. -Length: glacier length was determined as the length of the longest flowline for each glacier. -Bsns_elev_med: median elev of glacier basins",Alaska,0,0,9,1,2,0,85

The individual digitized glacier    boundaries were then adjusted manually based on the interpretation of    Landsat images.  All Landsat images were transformed to a common spatial    projection, WGS 1984 (World Geodetic System 1984).",Prince William Sound,0,0,9,1,4,0,58

Basin delineation was aided by an algorithm developed by C. Kienholz.; Landsat ETM+ images (LE70590192010259EDC00 and LE70600192010266EDC01) were downloaded from the USGS Earth Explorer (http://edcsns17.cr.usgs.gov/NewEarthExplorer/) and run through a de-striping algorithm.  This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.  The resulting basins were then manually edited to fix errors and better represent reality.",Alaska,0,0,9,1,6,0,48

Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.  The resulting basins were then manually edited to fix errors and better represent reality.",Alaska,0,0,9,1,6,0,27

The glacier outlines were initially created from USGS 1:63,360-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) files.  Because these ""glacier and permanent snowfield"" outlines often had digitizing errors, we laboriously edited them to fit the Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) files.  Thus, they represent what is on the DRG files, which in turn represent what is shown on the topo maps, which in turn shows what existed on the ground at the time the air photos were flown to make the maps.  The processing for these files was exactly the same as described in Manley (2008): Manley, W.F., 2008, Geospatial inventory and analysis of glaciers: A case study for the eastern Alaska Range, in Glaciers of Alaska, Williams, R. S., Jr., and Ferrigno, J. G., eds., Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World: USGS Professional Paper 1386-K, p. K424-K439. Explanation of some attributes: -Average aspect (facing direction, orientation) in degrees azimuth incorporates circular statistics (cf. Davis, 1986). -ELA60 is the ""hypsometric"" Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) using an Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR). For this Area, the AAR used was 60%. -cmpctnss: glacier compactness is a shape measure reflecting circularity (cf. Allen et al., 1998).  A non-dimensional measure, it ranges from 0.0 for a straight line to 1.0 for a circle, and is calculated as (4 * pi * area ) / (perimeter squared). -slope: average slope angle, in degrees, for each of the M1 glaciers.  It uses the slope angle grid generated from the DEM, then simply calculates, or scores, the average slope angle across the surface of each glacier. -L_W_ratio: his script calculates the length to width ratio, which is a shape factor that might be of use later for classifying or comparing glaciers. The length:width ratio is <1.0 for short but wide glaciers hugging cirque headwalls, and is > ca. 5 for long valley glaciers. -Length: glacier length was determined as the length of the longest flowline for each glacier. -Bsns_elev_med: median elev of glacier basins",Alaska,0,0,9,1,2,0,85

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.  The resulting basins were then manually edited to fix errors and better represent reality.",Alaska,0,0,9,1,6,0,51

The glacier outlines were initially created from USGS 1:63,360-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) files.  Because these ""glacier and permanent snowfield"" outlines often had digitizing errors, we laboriously edited them to fit the Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) files.  Thus, they represent what is on the DRG files, which in turn represent what is shown on the topo maps, which in turn shows what existed on the ground at the time the air photos were flown to make the maps.  The processing for these files was exactly the same as described in Manley (2008): Manley, W.F., 2008, Geospatial inventory and analysis of glaciers: A case study for the eastern Alaska Range, in Glaciers of Alaska, Williams, R. S., Jr., and Ferrigno, J. G., eds., Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World: USGS Professional Paper 1386-K, p. K424-K439. Explanation of some attributes: -Average aspect (facing direction, orientation) in degrees azimuth incorporates circular statistics (cf. Davis, 1986). -ELA60 is the ""hypsometric"" Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) using an Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR). For this Area, the AAR used was 60%. -cmpctnss: glacier compactness is a shape measure reflecting circularity (cf. Allen et al., 1998).  A non-dimensional measure, it ranges from 0.0 for a straight line to 1.0 for a circle, and is calculated as (4 * pi * area ) / (perimeter squared). -slope: average slope angle, in degrees, for each of the M1 glaciers.  It uses the slope angle grid generated from the DEM, then simply calculates, or scores, the average slope angle across the surface of each glacier. -L_W_ratio: his script calculates the length to width ratio, which is a shape factor that might be of use later for classifying or comparing glaciers. The length:width ratio is <1.0 for short but wide glaciers hugging cirque headwalls, and is > ca. 5 for long valley glaciers. -Length: glacier length was determined as the length of the longest flowline for each glacier. -Bsns_elev_med: median elev of glacier basins",Alaska,0,0,9,1,2,0,85

The glacier outlines were initially created from USGS 1:63,360-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) files.  Because these ""glacier and permanent snowfield"" outlines often had digitizing errors, we laboriously edited them to fit the Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) files.  Thus, they represent what is on the DRG files, which in turn represent what is shown on the topo maps, which in turn shows what existed on the ground at the time the air photos were flown to make the maps.  The processing for these files was exactly the same as described in Manley (2008): Manley, W.F., 2008, Geospatial inventory and analysis of glaciers: A case study for the eastern Alaska Range, in Glaciers of Alaska, Williams, R. S., Jr., and Ferrigno, J. G., eds., Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World: USGS Professional Paper 1386-K, p. K424-K439. Explanation of some attributes: -Average aspect (facing direction, orientation) in degrees azimuth incorporates circular statistics (cf. Davis, 1986). -ELA60 is the ""hypsometric"" Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) using an Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR). For this Area, the AAR used was 60%. -cmpctnss: glacier compactness is a shape measure reflecting circularity (cf. Allen et al., 1998).  A non-dimensional measure, it ranges from 0.0 for a straight line to 1.0 for a circle, and is calculated as (4 * pi * area ) / (perimeter squared). -slope: average slope angle, in degrees, for each of the M1 glaciers.  It uses the slope angle grid generated from the DEM, then simply calculates, or scores, the average slope angle across the surface of each glacier. -L_W_ratio: his script calculates the length to width ratio, which is a shape factor that might be of use later for classifying or comparing glaciers. The length:width ratio is <1.0 for short but wide glaciers hugging cirque headwalls, and is > ca. 5 for long valley glaciers. -Length: glacier length was determined as the length of the longest flowline for each glacier. -Bsns_elev_med: median elev of glacier basins",Alaska,0,0,9,1,2,0,32

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.

False color composite    bands of red and green (5, 4, 3), were used to digitize glaciers. Before    digitizing each glacier, the location of stationary landmarks on    topographic maps and Landsat images were compared to determine if manual    georeferencing corrections were necessary.  RGI outline shapefiles (RGI    Consortium, 2017)  provided the initial glacier boundaries and divides into    the upper portions of the glaciers.  The individual digitized glacier    boundaries were then adjusted manually based on the interpretation of    Landsat images.  All Landsat images were transformed to a common spatial    projection, WGS 1984 (World Geodetic System 1984).",Prince William Sound,0,0,9,1,4,0,17

The glacier outlines were initially created from USGS 1:63,360-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) files.  Because these ""glacier and permanent snowfield"" outlines often had digitizing errors, we laboriously edited them to fit the Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) files.  Thus, they represent what is on the DRG files, which in turn represent what is shown on the topo maps, which in turn shows what existed on the ground at the time the air photos were flown to make the maps.  The processing for these files was exactly the same as described in Manley (2008): Manley, W.F., 2008, Geospatial inventory and analysis of glaciers: A case study for the eastern Alaska Range, in Glaciers of Alaska, Williams, R. S., Jr., and Ferrigno, J. G., eds., Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World: USGS Professional Paper 1386-K, p. K424-K439. Explanation of some attributes: -Average aspect (facing direction, orientation) in degrees azimuth incorporates circular statistics (cf. Davis, 1986). -ELA60 is the ""hypsometric"" Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) using an Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR). For this Area, the AAR used was 60%. -cmpctnss: glacier compactness is a shape measure reflecting circularity (cf. Allen et al., 1998).  A non-dimensional measure, it ranges from 0.0 for a straight line to 1.0 for a circle, and is calculated as (4 * pi * area ) / (perimeter squared). -slope: average slope angle, in degrees, for each of the M1 glaciers.  It uses the slope angle grid generated from the DEM, then simply calculates, or scores, the average slope angle across the surface of each glacier. -L_W_ratio: his script calculates the length to width ratio, which is a shape factor that might be of use later for classifying or comparing glaciers. The length:width ratio is <1.0 for short but wide glaciers hugging cirque headwalls, and is > ca. 5 for long valley glaciers. -Length: glacier length was determined as the length of the longest flowline for each glacier. -Bsns_elev_med: median elev of glacier basins",Alaska,0,0,9,1,2,0,85

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.  The resulting basins were then manually edited to fix errors and better represent reality.",Alaska,0,0,9,1,6,0,51

The glacier outlines were initially created from USGS 1:63,360-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) files.  Because these ""glacier and permanent snowfield"" outlines often had digitizing errors, we laboriously edited them to fit the Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) files.  Thus, they represent what is on the DRG files, which in turn represent what is shown on the topo maps, which in turn shows what existed on the ground at the time the air photos were flown to make the maps.  The processing for these files was exactly the same as described in Manley (2008): Manley, W.F., 2008, Geospatial inventory and analysis of glaciers: A case study for the eastern Alaska Range, in Glaciers of Alaska, Williams, R. S., Jr., and Ferrigno, J. G., eds., Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World: USGS Professional Paper 1386-K, p. K424-K439. Explanation of some attributes: -Average aspect (facing direction, orientation) in degrees azimuth incorporates circular statistics (cf. Davis, 1986). -ELA60 is the ""hypsometric"" Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) using an Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR). For this Area, the AAR used was 60%. -cmpctnss: glacier compactness is a shape measure reflecting circularity (cf. Allen et al., 1998).  A non-dimensional measure, it ranges from 0.0 for a straight line to 1.0 for a circle, and is calculated as (4 * pi * area ) / (perimeter squared). -slope: average slope angle, in degrees, for each of the M1 glaciers.  It uses the slope angle grid generated from the DEM, then simply calculates, or scores, the average slope angle across the surface of each glacier. -L_W_ratio: his script calculates the length to width ratio, which is a shape factor that might be of use later for classifying or comparing glaciers. The length:width ratio is <1.0 for short but wide glaciers hugging cirque headwalls, and is > ca. 5 for long valley glaciers. -Length: glacier length was determined as the length of the longest flowline for each glacier. -Bsns_elev_med: median elev of glacier basins",Alaska,0,0,9,1,2,0,32

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.

The glacier outlines were initially created from USGS 1:63,360-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) files.  Because these ""glacier and permanent snowfield"" outlines often had digitizing errors, we laboriously edited them to fit the Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) files.  Thus, they represent what is on the DRG files, which in turn represent what is shown on the topo maps, which in turn shows what existed on the ground at the time the air photos were flown to make the maps.  The processing for these files was exactly the same as described in Manley (2008): Manley, W.F., 2008, Geospatial inventory and analysis of glaciers: A case study for the eastern Alaska Range, in Glaciers of Alaska, Williams, R. S., Jr., and Ferrigno, J. G., eds., Satellite Image Atlas of Glaciers of the World: USGS Professional Paper 1386-K, p. K424-K439. Explanation of some attributes: -Average aspect (facing direction, orientation) in degrees azimuth incorporates circular statistics (cf. Davis, 1986). -ELA60 is the ""hypsometric"" Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) using an Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR). For this Area, the AAR used was 60%. -cmpctnss: glacier compactness is a shape measure reflecting circularity (cf. Allen et al., 1998).  A non-dimensional measure, it ranges from 0.0 for a straight line to 1.0 for a circle, and is calculated as (4 * pi * area ) / (perimeter squared). -slope: average slope angle, in degrees, for each of the M1 glaciers.  It uses the slope angle grid generated from the DEM, then simply calculates, or scores, the average slope angle across the surface of each glacier. -L_W_ratio: his script calculates the length to width ratio, which is a shape factor that might be of use later for classifying or comparing glaciers. The length:width ratio is <1.0 for short but wide glaciers hugging cirque headwalls, and is > ca. 5 for long valley glaciers. -Length: glacier length was determined as the length of the longest flowline for each glacier. -Bsns_elev_med: median elev of glacier basins",Alaska,0,0,9,1,2,0,85

Basin delineation was aided by an algorithm developed by C.

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.  The resulting basins were then manually edited to fix errors and better represent reality.",Alaska,0,0,9,1,6,0,51

Basin delineation was aided by an algorithm developed by C.

This algorithm uses a 7x7 moving window to fill in the missing data based on weighted averages.  This does not fix the data but does create a continuous dataset needed for the automated analysis.  Landsat ETM+ scenes were used to run an automated analysis that used a band3/band5 ratio, a thermal image converted from radiance to surface temperature and NDVI, in order to capture ice extent.  This worked well at identifying bare ice but ran into problems with heavily debris covered ice.  Extensive manual digitizing of the automated dataset was carried out in order to fix mis-classified areas and capture debris covered ice.  The resulting dataset was run through a script (written by Christian Kienholz, University of Bern, 2009-09-18) which delineated glaciers by drainage basin based on the National Elevation Dataset.  The resulting basins were then manually edited to fix errors and better represent reality.",Alaska,0,0,9,1,6,0,51
