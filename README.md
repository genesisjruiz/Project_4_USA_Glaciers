# Project_4_USA_Glaciers

## Project Objective

The primary objective of our project is to analyze the impact of temperature on the characteristics and changes of glaciers in the USA over time.

## Study Parameters

We will study key parameters such as:
- Line type
- Analysis ID
- Glacier ID
- Area
- Debris-covered area
- Minimum elevation
- Mean elevation
- Maximum elevation
- Source date

## Methodology

These parameters will be analyzed in relation to temperature data. Our aim is to track changes in these parameters over time and correlate them with temperature variations to understand their impact on glacier characteristics and changes.
